# Default Probability Prediction with HomeLoan Dataset (CIS545 Final Project)
<p>
This project is the final project of CIS545 Big Data Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</p><p>

In this project, we aim at predicting the probability of default with data from HomeLoan. The full dataset consists of three parts:
- `application_train.csv`, information about the applicant at the application time
- `bureau.csv` and `bureau_balance.csv`, past data from the credit bureau
- past payments, such as spending history, credit card balance history

</p><p>

I primarily worked on `bureau.csv` and `bureau_balance.csv` in this project.
